# E-Voting

## Description
The Mobile Android Voting Application is an intuitive and user-friendly application designed to facilitate voting processes on mobile devices running the Android operating system. This application utilizes SQLite databases, messaging functionality, and ListView to provide a seamless voting experience. Users are required to create an account by providing their phone number and authenticate themselves by receiving and entering a 5-digit verification code.

## Features

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
Users are required to create an account within the application to participate in the voting process. During registration, users provide their phone number, and an authentication mechanism sends a 5-digit verification code to their phone. Users must enter this code to authenticate themselves and gain access to the voting features.

### 2. Admin Login and Voting Option Management
An admin login is available to authorized personnel who can manage and edit the voting options. Admins have the flexibility to create, modify, or delete voting options dynamically, tailoring the voting process to specific requirements.

### 3. User-friendly Interface
The application provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the voting process. The ListView component is utilized to display the available voting options in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for users to make their selections.

### 4. Persistent Storage with SQLite Databases
The application utilizes SQLite databases for efficient and reliable data storage. This ensures that voting data is persistently stored, allowing administrators to access and analyze the results after the voting process has concluded.
